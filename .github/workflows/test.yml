# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

    # The CMake configure and build commands are platform agnostic and should work equally well on Windows or Mac.
    # You can convert this to a matrix build if you need cross-platform coverage.
